# t2vert
A utility to streamline color grading raw video files from the magic lantern project on linux (and maybe macosx?)

I built this originally to process raw video files shot using magic lantern and the canon t2i, it was an experiment to try
and push the T2i to its limits and see if we could get usable footage off that camera in raw well aware of its limitations in
regard to the speed at which it can right data to the SD card.  The experiment was a success, I shot a number of short videos
on the T2i, and this script can still work well with the T2i for those looking to push that camera to its limits. That being
said, i have updated this script to work best with the canon 50D as that is my current hobby camera for playing with raw video
