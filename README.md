# t2vert
A utility to streamline color grading raw video files from the magic lantern project on linux (and maybe macosx?)

right now I am mostly using a black magic design orignal pocket camera with this script. but I have left in the functionality
to dump MLV files for those wanting to use this script with magic lantern.  

I have stripped the optical flow video from the core script, as it was not up to date, and it was not something I was using anymore. if you still need it, or you need a script that can handle up the frame rate from 18 frames a second to 24 (as the original did) I have left the original script available, in a sub folder called, T2vert old.  people who are shooting on modern cameras at 24fps would be advised to avoid that folder, as that version of the script is a bit buggier then the current one.

I built this originally to process raw video files shot using magic lantern and the canon t2i, it was an experiment to try
and push the T2i to its limits and see if we could get usable footage off that camera in raw well aware of its limitations in
regard to the speed at which it can right data to the SD card.  The experiment was a success, I shot a number of short videos
on the T2i, and this script can still work well with the T2i for those looking to push that camera to its limits. That being
said, i have updated this script to work best with the canon 50D, 5D II and the black magic pocket camera (the original one)

I also include some cool features to create hdr video, for those who like the idea.
